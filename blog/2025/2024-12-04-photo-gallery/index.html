We are required to play a RPG game and write thoughts about it.</p> <p>Before starting this assignment, I spent a long time thinking about which game to analyze, and honestly, I struggled a lot. I really love Sekiro and Dark Souls 3—they’re at the top of my list, especially Sekiro, which is my absolute favorite. I have so many things I want to praise about its combat and level design. In fact, it’s because of Sekiro that I decided to become a game designer. But because I love these two games, or this type of game so much, I’ve already seen tons of other people’s analyses, which could influence mine. So today, I’m not going to talk about those two games. Instead, I’ve chosen to focus on the Assassin’s Creed series.</p> <p>My playthrough order of Assassin’s Creed might be different from others. I played Valhalla first, then went back to Origins and Odyssey, so I have experience with all three. As an action game fan, I mostly want to talk about the combat systems in these three games. To jump to my personal conclusion: out of the three, I prefer Valhalla. The first reason is that, compared to the other two, I like the combat feel in Valhalla more. The first two felt a bit too light, but Valhalla’s combat feels more solid and weighty. Plus, dual-wielding weapons in Valhalla just adds more satisfaction to the fights.</p> <p>Another thing I really like about Valhalla is that they added the posture meter. Once you break it, you can execute a finishing move and take down enemies instantly. Managing offense and defense makes the combat system more than just “button-mashing” (I love this feature—like they say, the best defense is a good offense, just like in Sekiro! :) ). Also, I think Valhalla’s progression curve feels more balanced, while in Odyssey, it felt too steep. Often, the fight was over before I could even really get into it, which didn’t help me get into the “flow.” As the game difficulty increases, your stats kind of explode, which didn’t feel like a great experience for me.</p> <p>Some people think the Mythology Trilogy has become too RPG-like. A game that was originally focused on stealth now doesn’t even let you assassinate in one hit—you need to consider levels, gear, and other factors, which feels like it goes against the whole “assassin” vibe. I don’t want to say which one is better, because in my opinion (and of course, feel free to disagree—this is just my take), RPG elements in action games are inevitable. It’s not just about the blending of action and RPG, but early game genres are all getting mixed as the industry evolves. Besides Assassin’s Creed, more and more games are blending action, RPG, and roguelike elements. Take God of War, for example, which became more RPG-like starting from the fourth game. And look at games like Dead Cells or Hades—action games that incorporate roguelike elements and have seen huge success. A game can be action, RPG, soulslike (yes, I’m bringing Sekiro up again, my favorite!), and it can even have simulation, management, or romance elements. But honestly, I don’t think the genre label matters as much. As long as players are having fun, that’s what counts.</p> </body></html>
