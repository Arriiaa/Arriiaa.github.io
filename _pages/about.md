Hi there! I'm Yiran Wang, a budding game designer with a lifelong passion for gaming ðŸŒ±

Growing up with video games naturally led me to pursue game design at Northeastern University. I'm particularly passionate about action games and JRPGs - with Sekiro being my absolute favorite. Its brilliant level design and combat system opened my eyes to the artistry of game design.

I also have a soft spot for indie games like Animal Well, which never cease to amaze me with their creativity. As an aspiring game designer, I'm excited to combine my gaming experience with fresh ideas to create experiences that can touch players' hearts.

If you're passionate about games too, I'd love to hear about your gaming experiences! Let's explore the endless possibilities of game design together
