<strong style="background-color: yellow;">This blog is written for the assignment of the GSND 5111 course. We are required to play a Rhythm game and write thoughts about it.</strong>


Right before starting this assignment, I played Hi-Fi Rush, a game that's famous for blending rhythm and action seamlessly. Before this, I’d tried plenty of games that mix music elements into their gameplay, like the roguelike-inspired Crypt of the NecroDancer and the FPS-driven Metal: Hellsinger. But Hi-Fi Rush totally blew me away with how well it combined rhythm and action.

First off, the whole game—not just the characters, but the environments and even the cutscenes—moves perfectly in sync with the beat. It’s impossible not to get caught up in the rhythm. I mean, I found myself instinctively tapping my feet and bobbing my head the entire time I was playing. The constant rhythm and melody aren’t just a cool extra—they’re the heart of the game’s mechanics.

What’s even better is how solid the action system is. Hi-Fi Rush has all the staples of a classic action game: combo finishers, air juggling, parry counters, team-up attacks, ultimate moves, performance scoring, and ranking systems. As someone who loves action games, this felt super familiar and satisfying. Plus, since all attacks—including enemy ones—are locked to the beat, you don’t need crazy fast reflexes or complicated input combos. Instead, you just time your actions to the rhythm, making it way easier to get into than a traditional action game.

And I have to shout out the ultimate moves in this game—they’re just awesome. There are over ten, and they’re all so dramatic and fun. From a cheeky parody of Cloud’s Braver to a hilarious group charm attack using an adorable cat, the flashy effects make the combat even more exciting. (Honestly, the cat, 808, might be even cuter than the one from Stray. Just saying!)

Playing Hi-Fi Rush was such a fun and unique experience. It’s crazy how everything in the game flows perfectly to the beat, and the combat is both satisfying and super approachable. Plus, I couldn’t stop grinning at the over-the-top ultimate moves (and yeah, 808 totally stole the show for me). It’s one of those games that just makes you want to keep playing and maybe even rethink how rhythm can make everything more fun. Honestly, 10/10 would tap my feet and headbang through it again.
