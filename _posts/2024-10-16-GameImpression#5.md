<strong style="background-color: yellow;">This blog is written for the assignment of the GSND 5111 course. We are required to play a Puzzle game and write thoughts about it.</strong>

2048 has become a permanent game on my phone. Unlike some other mobile gamers who might prefer more intense or strategic games, my phone is filled with games like 2048 and Eggshell Agent. These games are perfect for short, casual play sessions, making them an ideal fit for my fragmented free time. They don’t require a lot of mental energy or high-level focus, which makes them a unique form of entertainment for me. I find 2048 especially relaxing because of its simple controls — just swiping up, down, left, or right — which allows me to quickly get into the game without a steep learning curve.

One of the reasons I really enjoy 2048 is its minimalist design. The game has no unnecessary distractions, and the soft color palette helps me stay focused on merging numbers without tiring from complex visual effects. The simplicity in both mechanics and visuals contributes to a calming atmosphere, which is perfect for moments when I need a quick mental break but still want a little bit of challenge.

What I appreciate the most about 2048 is its low-pressure nature combined with its subtle sense of challenge. Even when I make mistakes in the game, I don’t feel a huge psychological burden. Unlike more demanding games where a single misstep could frustrate me, 2048 allows me to embrace my errors and enjoy the opportunity to start fresh. The growing numbers present an ongoing personal challenge that keeps me focused, but without the stress.

For me, playing 2048 feels more like an intrinsic motivation — it’s not something I have to push myself to do. I simply open the app during my downtime, and I can dive into a straightforward yet engaging game that lets me test my abilities in a relaxed way. This balance of casual gameplay, mental challenge, and relaxation makes 2048 a unique source of enjoyment in my daily life.
