<strong style="background-color: yellow;">This blog is written for the assignment of the GSND 5111 course. We are required to play a MMO game and write thoughts about it.</strong>

This week, I had the chance to experience FF14. As an experienced MMO player, I’ve previously enjoyed games like Blade & Soul, JX3, and Moonlight Blade. I’d heard a lot about FF14 and was quite intrigued, so I bought a max-level account and played for around five hours (in my opinion, the true MMO experience often begins once you reach max level). What attracts me most to MMOs are the variety of dungeon battles and the social aspects. Today, I’d like to focus on FF14's combat.

First off, I’m a heavy action game enthusiast, so I tend to choose melee classes in MMOs. After trying out various MMOs, I found that the combat system in MMOs differs significantly from that of single-player action games. The first major difference is combat pace: in MMOs, combat is typically slower, relying more on skill cooldowns and team coordination. Players often follow a set sequence or rotation of skills, focusing on efficient damage output or healing. Teamwork is essential, with each role depending on the others to function well. On the other hand, single-player action games, like Sekiro or Devil May Cry, have faster and more intense combat that requires players to react and anticipate accurately. Combat is usually in real-time, emphasizing smooth movements and observation of enemy attacks, relying more on player skill and focus.

The second major difference is the complexity of controls. MMO controls are typically centered around hotkeys and skill bars, allowing players to trigger various abilities with shortcuts. Skills cover a wide range of effects, though individual abilities are generally simpler. In MMOs, strategies for damage output and defense often depend on stats, gear, and cooldown management. In contrast, single-player action games emphasize control complexity through precise attacks, dodges, blocks, and counters. There’s no extensive skill bar system; instead, players must respond continuously in combat and have a good sense of timing. Different weapons and move combinations offer distinct combat experiences.

In summary, MMO combat systems differ greatly from those of single-player action games. MMOs emphasize team collaboration and strategy, while action games focus more on individual skill and real-time reactions. Each has its unique appeal, offering distinct challenges and enjoyment for players.
