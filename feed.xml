We are required to play a MMO game and write thoughts about it.</p> <p>This week, I had the chance to experience FF14. As an experienced MMO player, I’ve previously enjoyed games like Blade &amp; Soul, JX3, and Moonlight Blade. I’d heard a lot about FF14 and was quite intrigued, so I bought a max-level account and played for around five hours (in my opinion, the true MMO experience often begins once you reach max level). What attracts me most to MMOs are the variety of dungeon battles and the social aspects. Today, I’d like to focus on FF14’s combat.</p> <p>First off, I’m a heavy action game enthusiast, so I tend to choose melee classes in MMOs. After trying out various MMOs, I found that the combat system in MMOs differs significantly from that of single-player action games. The first major difference is combat pace: in MMOs, combat is typically slower, relying more on skill cooldowns and team coordination. Players often follow a set sequence or rotation of skills, focusing on efficient damage output or healing. Teamwork is essential, with each role depending on the others to function well. On the other hand, single-player action games, like Sekiro or Devil May Cry, have faster and more intense combat that requires players to react and anticipate accurately. Combat is usually in real-time, emphasizing smooth movements and observation of enemy attacks, relying more on player skill and focus.</p> <p>The second major difference is the complexity of controls. MMO controls are typically centered around hotkeys and skill bars, allowing players to trigger various abilities with shortcuts. Skills cover a wide range of effects, though individual abilities are generally simpler. In MMOs, strategies for damage output and defense often depend on stats, gear, and cooldown management. In contrast, single-player action games emphasize control complexity through precise attacks, dodges, blocks, and counters. There’s no extensive skill bar system; instead, players must respond continuously in combat and have a good sense of timing. Different weapons and move combinations offer distinct combat experiences.</p> <p>In summary, MMO combat systems differ greatly from those of single-player action games. MMOs emphasize team collaboration and strategy, while action games focus more on individual skill and real-time reactions. Each has its unique appeal, offering distinct challenges and enjoyment for players.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="analysis"/><category term="game"/><category term="analysis"/><category term="FF14"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[A Game Analysis of FF14]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Game Impression #5: Hi-Fi Rush</title><link href="https://arriiaa.github.io/blog/2024/Game-Impression-10/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Game Impression #5: Hi-Fi Rush"/><published>2024-11-13T14:24:02+00:00</published><updated>2024-11-13T14:24:02+00:00</updated><id>https://arriiaa.github.io/blog/2024/Game%20Impression#10</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://arriiaa.github.io/blog/2024/Game-Impression-10/"><![CDATA[<p>This blog is written for the assignment of the GSND 5111 course. We are required to play a Rhythm game and write thoughts about it.</p> <p>Right before starting this assignment, I played Hi-Fi Rush, a game that’s famous for blending rhythm and action seamlessly. Before this, I’d tried plenty of games that mix music elements into their gameplay, like the roguelike-inspired Crypt of the NecroDancer and the FPS-driven Metal: Hellsinger. But Hi-Fi Rush totally blew me away with how well it combined rhythm and action.</p> <p>First off, the whole game—not just the characters, but the environments and even the cutscenes—moves perfectly in sync with the beat. It’s impossible not to get caught up in the rhythm. I mean, I found myself instinctively tapping my feet and bobbing my head the entire time I was playing. The constant rhythm and melody aren’t just a cool extra—they’re the heart of the game’s mechanics.</p> <p>What’s even better is how solid the action system is. Hi-Fi Rush has all the staples of a classic action game: combo finishers, air juggling, parry counters, team-up attacks, ultimate moves, performance scoring, and ranking systems. As someone who loves action games, this felt super familiar and satisfying. Plus, since all attacks—including enemy ones—are locked to the beat, you don’t need crazy fast reflexes or complicated input combos. Instead, you just time your actions to the rhythm, making it way easier to get into than a traditional action game.</p> <p>And I have to shout out the ultimate moves in this game—they’re just awesome. There are over ten, and they’re all so dramatic and fun. From a cheeky parody of Cloud’s Braver to a hilarious group charm attack using an adorable cat, the flashy effects make the combat even more exciting. (Honestly, the cat, 808, might be even cuter than the one from Stray. Just saying!)</p> <p>Playing Hi-Fi Rush was such a fun and unique experience. It’s crazy how everything in the game flows perfectly to the beat, and the combat is both satisfying and super approachable. Plus, I couldn’t stop grinning at the over-the-top ultimate moves (and yeah, 808 totally stole the show for me). It’s one of those games that just makes you want to keep playing and maybe even rethink how rhythm can make everything more fun. Honestly, 10/10 would tap my feet and headbang through it again.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="analysis"/><category term="game"/><category term="analysis"/><category term="Rhythm"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[A Game Analysis of Hi-Fi Rush]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Game Impression #5: 2048</title><link href="https://arriiaa.github.io/blog/2024/GameImpression-5/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Game Impression #5: 2048"/><published>2024-10-16T14:24:02+00:00</published><updated>2024-10-16T14:24:02+00:00</updated><id>https://arriiaa.github.io/blog/2024/GameImpression#5</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://arriiaa.github.io/blog/2024/GameImpression-5/"><![CDATA[<p>This blog is written for the assignment of the GSND 5111 course. We are required to play a Puzzle game and write thoughts about it.</p> <p>2048 has become a permanent game on my phone. Unlike some other mobile gamers who might prefer more intense or strategic games, my phone is filled with games like 2048 and Eggshell Agent. These games are perfect for short, casual play sessions, making them an ideal fit for my fragmented free time. They don’t require a lot of mental energy or high-level focus, which makes them a unique form of entertainment for me. I find 2048 especially relaxing because of its simple controls — just swiping up, down, left, or right — which allows me to quickly get into the game without a steep learning curve.</p> <p>One of the reasons I really enjoy 2048 is its minimalist design. The game has no unnecessary distractions, and the soft color palette helps me stay focused on merging numbers without tiring from complex visual effects. The simplicity in both mechanics and visuals contributes to a calming atmosphere, which is perfect for moments when I need a quick mental break but still want a little bit of challenge.</p> <p>What I appreciate the most about 2048 is its low-pressure nature combined with its subtle sense of challenge. Even when I make mistakes in the game, I don’t feel a huge psychological burden. Unlike more demanding games where a single misstep could frustrate me, 2048 allows me to embrace my errors and enjoy the opportunity to start fresh. The growing numbers present an ongoing personal challenge that keeps me focused, but without the stress.</p> <p>For me, playing 2048 feels more like an intrinsic motivation — it’s not something I have to push myself to do. I simply open the app during my downtime, and I can dive into a straightforward yet engaging game that lets me test my abilities in a relaxed way. This balance of casual gameplay, mental challenge, and relaxation makes 2048 a unique source of enjoyment in my daily life.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="analysis"/><category term="game"/><category term="analysis"/><category term="puzzle"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[A Game Analysis of 2048]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Game Impression #4: Ori and the Blind Forest/ Will o the Wisps</title><link href="https://arriiaa.github.io/blog/2024/GameImpression-4/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Game Impression #4: Ori and the Blind Forest/ Will o the Wisps"/><published>2024-10-06T14:24:02+00:00</published><updated>2024-10-06T14:24:02+00:00</updated><id>https://arriiaa.github.io/blog/2024/GameImpression#4</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://arriiaa.github.io/blog/2024/GameImpression-4/"><![CDATA[<p>This blog is written for the assignment of the GSND 5111 course. We are required to play a Platformer game and write thoughts about it.</p> <p>Ori is undoubtedly my favorite indie game. Whether it’s Ori and the Blind Forest or Ori and the Will of the Wisps, both hold an irreplaceable place in my heart. The beauty, atmosphere, and emotional depth of these games are unlike anything else I’ve experienced. Today, I’d like to focus on Ori and the Will of the Wisps and share why it resonates with me so deeply.</p> <p>I’m not going to dwell on how breathtaking the game’s art is—this is something that has captivated countless players from beginning to end. From the haunting beauty of the dark forests to the vibrant, glowing landscapes, every scene is a visual masterpiece. But what truly sets Will of the Wisps apart for me is its story, and how that story reflects themes of hope, sacrifice, and the power of light in the face of overwhelming darkness.</p> <p>The game’s narrative is subtle, yet profound. A small flicker of light can illuminate endless darkness—this simple idea runs through the heart of the game. After finishing Will of the Wisps, I was left with a complex mix of emotions. It wasn’t sadness, nor was it pure joy, but rather a bittersweet, contemplative feeling that lingered long after the credits rolled. The game doesn’t rely on extensive dialogue or heavy-handed exposition to tell its story. Instead, it uses small, poignant moments—glances, and beautifully understated scenes—that allow players to interpret and feel the emotions themselves. In many ways, the lack of words allows the emotional weight to speak even louder.</p> <p>One moment that stood out to me was the achievement you unlock after completing the game: “Destined.” It’s a powerful word, and it perfectly encapsulates the story—a fable about fate, loss, and the inevitability of cycles. Ori’s journey is a tale of sacrifice, where even the smallest flicker of light can become the decisive force to push back against the encroaching darkness. This isn’t just Ori’s destiny, but also a metaphor for life, where hardship and loss are often necessary for growth and renewal. Ori’s light represents hope, perseverance, and the belief that even in the darkest times, a new beginning is always possible.</p> <p>The gameplay itself is also a key part of what makes Will of the Wisps so unforgettable. The controls are incredibly responsive and fluid—whether you’re executing a triple jump, climbing walls, gliding through the air, or dashing from one point to another, everything feels seamless. The variety of abilities Ori gains throughout the game adds a richness to the exploration and combat, and mastering these skills feels rewarding rather than overwhelming. Every movement is like a dance, and once you get the rhythm, the game flows beautifully, almost like a piece of choreography.</p> <p>Many players have remarked on the game’s difficulty, and I agree that some sections can be quite challenging, especially when it comes to navigating through complex environments or facing tough enemies. However, the difficulty feels perfectly aligned with the narrative themes. Life is full of obstacles, and the game captures this sentiment perfectly—every trial Ori faces mirrors the emotional hardships present in the story. It’s not just a game of skill but a game of endurance and perseverance, much like Ori’s journey itself.</p> <p>For me, Ori and the Will of the Wisps transcends the boundaries of what we typically think of as a “game.” It’s a work of art, a beautifully crafted experience that weaves together music, art, and storytelling into a single, emotional journey. The music, in particular, deserves special mention—the orchestral score complements every moment, amplifying the emotional depth of each scene. Whether it’s a quiet, melancholic moment or a high-stakes chase through a crumbling ruin, the music draws you in and makes each moment feel even more impactful.</p> <p>This game isn’t just about playing—it’s about feeling. Every time I return to it, I’m reminded of the sheer beauty of its world, the weight of its story, and the impact it has had on me personally. Ori and the Will of the Wisps is more than a game—it’s a lasting, emotional experience that I will carry with me for a long time to come.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="analysis"/><category term="narrative"/><category term="analysis"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[A Game Analysis of Ori and the Blind Forest/ Will o the Wisps]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Game Impression #3: Assassin’s Creed series</title><link href="https://arriiaa.github.io/blog/2024/GameImpression1/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Game Impression #3: Assassin’s Creed series"/><published>2024-10-02T14:24:02+00:00</published><updated>2024-10-02T14:24:02+00:00</updated><id>https://arriiaa.github.io/blog/2024/GameImpression1</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://arriiaa.github.io/blog/2024/GameImpression1/"><![CDATA[<p><strong style="background-color: yellow;">This blog is written for the assignment of the GSND 5111 course. We are required to play a Action Adventure game and write thoughts about it.</strong></p> <p>Before starting this assignment, I spent a long time thinking about which game to analyze, and honestly, I struggled a lot. I really love Sekiro and Dark Souls 3—they’re at the top of my list, especially Sekiro, which is my absolute favorite. I have so many things I want to praise about its combat and level design. In fact, it’s because of Sekiro that I decided to become a game designer. But because I love these two games, or this type of game so much, I’ve already seen tons of other people’s analyses, which could influence mine. So today, I’m not going to talk about those two games. Instead, I’ve chosen to focus on the Assassin’s Creed series.</p> <p>My playthrough order of Assassin’s Creed might be different from others. I played Valhalla first, then went back to Origins and Odyssey, so I have experience with all three. As an action game fan, I mostly want to talk about the combat systems in these three games. To jump to my personal conclusion: out of the three, I prefer Valhalla. The first reason is that, compared to the other two, I like the combat feel in Valhalla more. The first two felt a bit too light, but Valhalla’s combat feels more solid and weighty. Plus, dual-wielding weapons in Valhalla just adds more satisfaction to the fights.</p> <p>Another thing I really like about Valhalla is that they added the posture meter. Once you break it, you can execute a finishing move and take down enemies instantly. Managing offense and defense makes the combat system more than just “button-mashing” (I love this feature—like they say, the best defense is a good offense, just like in Sekiro! :) ). Also, I think Valhalla’s progression curve feels more balanced, while in Odyssey, it felt too steep. Often, the fight was over before I could even really get into it, which didn’t help me get into the “flow.” As the game difficulty increases, your stats kind of explode, which didn’t feel like a great experience for me.</p> <p>Some people think the Mythology Trilogy has become too RPG-like. A game that was originally focused on stealth now doesn’t even let you assassinate in one hit—you need to consider levels, gear, and other factors, which feels like it goes against the whole “assassin” vibe. I don’t want to say which one is better, because in my opinion (and of course, feel free to disagree—this is just my take), RPG elements in action games are inevitable. It’s not just about the blending of action and RPG, but early game genres are all getting mixed as the industry evolves. Besides Assassin’s Creed, more and more games are blending action, RPG, and roguelike elements. Take God of War, for example, which became more RPG-like starting from the fourth game. And look at games like Dead Cells or Hades—action games that incorporate roguelike elements and have seen huge success. A game can be action, RPG, soulslike (yes, I’m bringing Sekiro up again, my favorite!), and it can even have simulation, management, or romance elements. But honestly, I don’t think the genre label matters as much. As long as players are having fun, that’s what counts.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="analysis"/><category term="combat"/><category term="analysis"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[A Game Analysis of the Combat System in Assassin's Creed]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Google Gemini updates: Flash 1.5, Gemma 2 and Project Astra</title><link href="https://arriiaa.github.io/blog/2024/google-gemini-updates-flash-15-gemma-2-and-project-astra/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Google Gemini updates: Flash 1.5, Gemma 2 and Project Astra"/><published>2024-05-14T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-05-14T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://arriiaa.github.io/blog/2024/google-gemini-updates-flash-15-gemma-2-and-project-astra</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://arriiaa.github.io/blog/2024/google-gemini-updates-flash-15-gemma-2-and-project-astra/"><![CDATA[<p>May 14, 2024[[read-time]] min read We’re introducing a series of updates across the Gemini family of models, including the new 1.5 Flash, our lightweight model for speed and efficiency, and Project Astra, our vision for the future of AI assistants. In December, we launched our first natively multimodal model Gemini 1.0 in three sizes: Ultra, Pro and Nano. Just a few months later we released 1.5 Pro, with enhanced performance and a breakthrough long context window of 1 million tokens.Developers and enterprise customers have been putting 1.5 Pro to use in incredible ways and finding its long context window, multimodal reasoning capabilities and impressive overall performance incredibly useful.We know from user feedback that some applications need lower latency and a lower cost to serve. This inspired us to keep innovating, so today, we’re introducing Gemini 1.5 Flash: a model that’s lighter-weight than 1.5 Pro, and designed to be fast and efficient to serve at scale.Both 1.5 Pro and 1.5 Flash are available in public preview with a 1 million token context window in Google AI Studio and Vertex AI. And now, 1.5 Pro is also available with a 2 million token context window via waitlist to developers using the API and to Google Cloud customers.We’re also introducing updates across the Gemini family of models, announcing our next generation of open models, Gemma 2, and sharing progress on the future of AI assistants, with Project Astra.Context lengths of leading foundation models compared with Gemini 1.5’s 2 million token capability1.5 Flash is the newest addition to the Gemini model family and the fastest Gemini model served in the API. It’s optimized for high-volume, high-frequency tasks at scale, is more cost-efficient to serve and features our breakthrough long context window.While it’s a lighter weight model than 1.5 Pro, it’s highly capable of multimodal reasoning across vast amounts of information and delivers impressive quality for its size.The new Gemini 1.5 Flash model is optimized for speed and efficiency, is highly capable of multimodal reasoning and features our breakthrough long context window.1.5 Flash excels at summarization, chat applications, image and video captioning, data extraction from long documents and tables, and more. This is because it’s been trained by 1.5 Pro through a process called “distillation,” where the most essential knowledge and skills from a larger model are transferred to a smaller, more efficient model.Read more about 1.5 Flash in our updated Gemini 1.5 technical report, on the Gemini technology page, and learn about 1.5 Flash’s availability and pricing.Over the last few months, we’ve significantly improved 1.5 Pro, our best model for general performance across a wide range of tasks.Beyond extending its context window to 2 million tokens, we’ve enhanced its code generation, logical reasoning and planning, multi-turn conversation, and audio and image understanding through data and algorithmic advances. We see strong improvements on public and internal benchmarks for each of these tasks.1.5 Pro can now follow increasingly complex and nuanced instructions, including ones that specify product-level behavior involving role, format and style. We’ve improved control over the model’s responses for specific use cases, like crafting the persona and response style of a chat agent or automating workflows through multiple function calls. And we’ve enabled users to steer model behavior by setting system instructions.We added audio understanding in the Gemini API and Google AI Studio, so 1.5 Pro can now reason across image and audio for videos uploaded in Google AI Studio. And we’re now integrating 1.5 Pro into Google products, including Gemini Advanced and in Workspace apps.Read more about 1.5 Pro in our updated Gemini 1.5 technical report and on the Gemini technology page.Gemini Nano is expanding beyond text-only inputs to include images as well. Starting with Pixel, applications using Gemini Nano with Multimodality will be able to understand the world the way people do — not just through text, but also through sight, sound and spoken language.Read more about Gemini 1.0 Nano on Android.Today, we’re also sharing a series of updates to Gemma, our family of open models built from the same research and technology used to create the Gemini models.We’re announcing Gemma 2, our next generation of open models for responsible AI innovation. Gemma 2 has a new architecture designed for breakthrough performance and efficiency, and will be available in new sizes.The Gemma family is also expanding with PaliGemma, our first vision-language model inspired by PaLI-3. And we’ve upgraded our Responsible Generative AI Toolkit with LLM Comparator for evaluating the quality of model responses.Read more on the Developer blog.As part of Google DeepMind’s mission to build AI responsibly to benefit humanity, we’ve always wanted to develop universal AI agents that can be helpful in everyday life. That’s why today, we’re sharing our progress in building the future of AI assistants with Project Astra (advanced seeing and talking responsive agent).To be truly useful, an agent needs to understand and respond to the complex and dynamic world just like people do — and take in and remember what it sees and hears to understand context and take action. It also needs to be proactive, teachable and personal, so users can talk to it naturally and without lag or delay.While we’ve made incredible progress developing AI systems that can understand multimodal information, getting response time down to something conversational is a difficult engineering challenge. Over the past few years, we’ve been working to improve how our models perceive, reason and converse to make the pace and quality of interaction feel more natural.Building on Gemini, we’ve developed prototype agents that can process information faster by continuously encoding video frames, combining the video and speech input into a timeline of events, and caching this information for efficient recall.By leveraging our leading speech models, we also enhanced how they sound, giving the agents a wider range of intonations. These agents can better understand the context they’re being used in, and respond quickly, in conversation.With technology like this, it’s easy to envision a future where people could have an expert AI assistant by their side, through a phone or glasses. And some of these capabilities are coming to Google products, like the Gemini app and web experience, later this year.We’ve made incredible progress so far with our family of Gemini models, and we’re always striving to advance the state-of-the-art even further. By investing in a relentless production line of innovation, we’re able to explore new ideas at the frontier, while also unlocking the possibility of new and exciting Gemini use cases.Learn more about Gemini and its capabilities.
